# Contributing to Cauldron 
We welcome all contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas. We are working on our contribution guidelines, but in the meantime we can help you get started if you contact us directly on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/cauldron-notebook/Lobby). If you would rather wait for our guidelines, click to watch the Cauldron repository. Youâ€™ll stay up-to-date on our progress and may join us at any time.

# Reporting Bugs
The goal of the bug report is to explain to us how to reproduce the bug on our computers. Only submit a report for a bug you can reproduce. Limit your report to one bug (no bug is too small to report). Include as much detail as possible in clear, precise English.  Please include in your report:
* A title that explains the bug  in a few words
* The steps to reproduce the bug
* Expected results
* Actual results
* What you have tried to fix the bug
* The version of Cauldron
* Versions of all relevant software, e.g., python, operating systems, etc.
