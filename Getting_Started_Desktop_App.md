# Getting Started with the Cauldron Desktop App

Cauldron can be used as either through its Command Line Interface (CLI) or with the Cauldron desktop application. This document explains using Cauldron Desktop application.

There are two steps to installing Cauldron. First you need to install the Python package using either pip or conda. After that you need to download and install the desktop application for your particular operating system.

## System Requirements

The following system requirements must be met for Cauldron to work:

  ### Python 3
  Cauldron and uses the latest and greatest Python 3 has to offer and works with the following Python 3 versions:
  
  * 3.5.3+
  * 3.6.3+
  * 3.7 (coming soon)
  
Python 2 is nearing its end of life and lacks the necessary functionality to be supported.
  
### 64 Bit OS
The desktop application is available for OSX, Windows and multiple Linux distributions, but they must be the 64 bit versions.
  
  
## 1. Installing the Python Package
  
Cauldron is distributed as a pure-python wheel, meaning that it can be easily installed and used on any system that supports Python 3. It is, therefore, possible to use the Cauldron Python and its built-in command line interface (CLI) on a wide range of operating systems.
  
The package can be installed either using conda for Anaconda users:
  
<pre>$ conda install -c sernst cauldron$</pre>
  
or from Python's official package index (PyPI) using pip:  
  
<pre>$ pip install cauldron-notebook$</pre>
